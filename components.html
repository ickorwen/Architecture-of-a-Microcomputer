			<img src="images/components/CPU.png" alt="CPU Image">
			<p>Central Processing Unit (CPU)</p>
			<p>The CPU is the brain of the computer. It performs instructions from programs by carrying out basic arithmetic, logic, control, and input/output operations.</p>
			<p>It consists of an ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit) for calculations, a control unit for managing instructions, and registers for temporary data storage.</p>
			<p>The CPU communicates with RAM (for data storage), input/output devices, and other components through the motherboardâ€™s bus system. It processes data and sends the results to the relevant devices or storage.</p>

		<section id="ram" class="content hidden">
			<img src="images/components/RAM.png" alt="RAM Image">
			<p>Random Access Memory(RAM)</p>
			<p>RAM is temporary, high-speed memory used to store data and instructions that the CPU needs for immediate tasks.</p>
			<p>RAM is volatile, meaning it loses data when the computer is powered off. It is much faster than storage but has limited capacity.</p>
			<p>The CPU accesses RAM for data that is actively being processed. RAM stores data for running programs and operating system tasks that need quick access.</p>

		<section id="motherboard" class="content hidden">
			<img src="images/components/MOTHERBOARD.png" alt="Motherboard Image">
			<p>Motherboard</p>
			<p>The motherboard is the main circuit board of the microcomputer that holds and connects all the primary components.</p>
			<p>It contains sockets for the CPU, memory (RAM), and expansion cards (like GPU). It also houses chipsets that manage communication between components and has connectors for storage devices and input/output peripherals.</p>
			<p>The motherboard provides the necessary electrical pathways for components to communicate with each other. It connects the CPU, RAM, storage, GPU, and other peripherals.</p>			
		</section>

		<section id="storage" class="content hidden">
			<img src="images/components/HDD.png" alt="Motherboard Image">
			<p>Storage</p>
			<p>Storage devices like hard drives (HDD) or solid-state drives (SSD) are used to store data permanently (or until deleted).</p>			
			<p>HDDs use spinning disks for data storage, while SSDs use flash memory for faster access speeds.</p>
			<p>The storage devices are connected to the motherboard, and the CPU retrieves or saves data from/to storage. They store the operating system, applications, and user data.</p>
		</section>

		<section id="gpu" class="content hidden">
			<img src="images/components/GPU.png" alt="Motherboard Image">
			<p>Graphics Processing Unit(GPU)</p>
			<p>The GPU is specialized hardware used for rendering images and video, essential for gaming, design, and video editing.</p>
			<p>GPUs have multiple cores optimized for parallel processing, which makes them highly efficient for tasks like 3D rendering and video decoding.</p>
			<p>The GPU is connected to the motherboard (often via PCIe slots) and works closely with the CPU to render graphics that are displayed on the monitor. The CPU sends rendering instructions to the GPU, which processes them and outputs visual data.</p>

		</section>

		<section id="bus" class="content hidden">
			<img src="images/components/Busses.png" alt="Motherboard Image">
			<p>Bus</p>
			<p>A bus is a communication pathway that transfers data between components like the CPU, memory, storage, and peripherals.</p>
			<p>Buses consist of data, address, and control lines that carry the signals required for these transfers.</p>
			<p>The bus carries information between components. For example, the CPU sends data to RAM via the data bus, or the GPU uses the bus to send processed graphics data to the display.</p>

			<div class="directory">

		<section id="iodevices" class="content hidden">
			<img src="images/components/KEYBOARD.png" alt="Motherboard Image">
			<p>I/O Devices</p>
			<p>I/O devices allow the computer to interact with the outside world by accepting input and delivering output.</p>
			<p>Input devices (like keyboards, mice, microphones) allow users to send data to the computer, while output devices (like monitors, speakers, printers) present processed data to the user.</p>
			<p>The CPU processes input data received from I/O devices and sends output to display devices or other peripherals via the motherboard.</p>

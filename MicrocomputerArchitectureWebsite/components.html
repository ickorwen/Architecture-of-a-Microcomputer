			<p>Central Processing Unit (CPU)</p>
			<p>The CPU is the center of the microcomputer—everything revolves around it. Dubbed the “brain” of the system, it’s where all the decision-making and number-crunching happens. Whether you’re opening a meme folder or simulating the collapse of a star in astrophysics, the CPU is the one doing the heavy lifting.</p>
			<p>Today’s CPUs are marvels of engineering, boasting billions of tiny transistors packed onto a chip smaller than your fingernail. These transistors act like microscopic switches, flipping on and off to process data at mind-bending speeds.</p>
			<p>Fun fact: Early microprocessors like the Intel 4004 (released in 1971) could process just 92,000 instructions per second. Compare that to modern CPUs, which can handle trillions. Talk about glow-ups.</p>

		<section id="ram" class="content hidden">
			<img src="images/components/RAM.png" alt="RAM Image">
			<p>RAM is like the temporary workspace of your computer. Imagine you’re baking cookies, and your kitchen counter is where you mix the dough, roll it out, and shape it. RAM is that counter—fast, accessible, and absolutely essential.</p>            
			<p>But here’s the catch: RAM doesn’t store anything permanently. When you turn off your computer, it’s like cleaning the counter—everything gets wiped. That’s why having more RAM is crucial for multitasking. Open too many tabs in Chrome? RAM’s the one taking the hit (and probably screaming silently in binary).</p>

		<section id="motherboard" class="content hidden">
			<img src="images/components/MOTHERBOARD.png" alt="Motherboard Image">
			<p>The motherboard is like the stage crew, ensuring the CPU, RAM, and storage all communicate harmoniously. It’s a circuit board filled with connectors, slots, and chips that keep everything talking to each other.</p>
			<p> It’s also where you’ll find some crucial chips like the BIOS/UEFI, which is like your system’s manager. It tells the computer how to boot up and checks that everything’s working fine before handing off control to the operating system.</p>
			<p> Pro tip: The motherboard also determines what upgrades your computer can handle. So if you’re planning to go full Tony Stark with your rig, pick your motherboard wisely.</p>

		<section id="storage" class="content hidden">
			<img src="images/components/CPU.png" alt="Motherboard Image">
			<p>Storage devices like SSDs and HDDs are your system’s long-term memory. This is where all your files, apps, and OS live. SSDs are the newer, cooler cousins of HDDs—faster, more durable, and completely silent. But HDDs still hang around because they’re cheaper and offer more storage space for all those 4K cat videos (and the memes, of course).</p>

			<img src="images/components/CPU.png" alt="Motherboard Image">
			<p>Your monitor, keyboard, mouse, and speakers are like the band’s interaction with the crowd. They translate your inputs (keyboard clicks, mouse movements) into computer instructions and show you the results on-screen. Without these, your microcomputer is just a glorified paperweight.</p>

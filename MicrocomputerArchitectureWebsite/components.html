            <p>A computer’s motherboard is typically the largest printed circuit board in a machine’s chassis. It distributes electricity and facilitates communication between and to the central processing unit (CPU), random access memory (RAM), and any other component of the computer’s hardware. There is a broad range of motherboards, each of which is intended to be compatible with a specific model and size of the computer.

                Since different kinds of processors and memories are intended to function best with certain types of motherboards, it is difficult to find a motherboard that is compatible with every type of CPU and memory. Hard drives, on the other hand, are generally compatible with a wide variety of motherboards and may be used with most brands and types.
                
                A computer motherboard may be found inside a computer casing, which is the point of connection for most of the computer’s elements and peripherals. When it comes to tower computers, one may look for a motherboard on either the right or left side of the tower; the circuit board is the most significant.
                
                The earliest motherboards for personal computers included relatively fewer real components. Only a CPU and some card ports were included on the very first IBM PC motherboard. Users inserted various components, including memory and controllers for floppy drives, into the slots provided. 
                
                Compaq became the first company to utilize a motherboard that was not based on a design created by IBM. The new architecture utilized a CPU made by Intel. When Compaq’s sales began to take off, other businesses quickly followed suit, even though several companies in the industry believed it was a risky move.</p>
